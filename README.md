Collaboration
The correct use of collaboration helps computing innovation that also reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it.
A computing innovation can be both physical (self driving car), non physical computing software(picture editing software) or a nonphysical computing concept.(e-commerce)
Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias.
Skills gained through collaboration are communication consensus building conflict resolution and negotiation.

Ways to collaborate
Pair programming two programmers in the roles of one being driver the other pointer.
Think-Pair-Share 
Students think through a problem alone, after wards pair and share ideas/results

Leave comments in code.

Collaboration apps in class
repl.it, Github
1.2
Program function and purpose
The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.
Understanding this provide developers improve the ability to develop.
Computing innovations
Applications,Systems, Physical devices
Guiding questions 
Why does the computer innovation exist?
What problems does the computing innovation solve
What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we couldnâ€™T do

Computers accept input such as tactile audio visual text based information
Most programs are written in an event driven enviroment
Events are triggered by some action which usually sends input to the program.
An action may be triggered by user or another programmer.
The program jumps to the code segment  the code segment is executed and output is triggered by the code segment
Code segments are executed as they are called according to the events triggered.
Vid 3
A program is a collection of statements( a statement is a single command a group of them is called a code segment
The description of a code segment should include what it does and how it was done

Program design and development
How to develop a program 
Developers start investigating the probelm and reflect. Developers must determine the requirement of the program, understand the constraints, understand the user concerns and interests. Some ways they investigate are surveys developer responses.
Brainstrom-Storyboard-Plan experience-late out the user interface-organize modules-testing strategy
A runtime error is when a program fails in the midst of running
Syntax error is a mistake that happens when made a typo
Logic error is a error that is cause by the proggrammer making mistkae in the algorithm.
Overflow error is when a program is required to perform a calculation that is outside defined range values.
Once error identified
