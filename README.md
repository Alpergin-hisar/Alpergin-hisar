Unit 1 values
Unit1.1-1.2

Programming is all about inputs and outputs. Inputs are what we provide to the computer and outputs are what happens when working with the inputs to produce something to us. These two are called values.

Data is a collection of individual values. Programming languages have ways to express and manipulate data. The term for representing a value is expression.

Naming is a from of abstraction. When people use a name to refer to something they thing about the best way to dress what is infant of them shortly.

In programming names are called identifiers that reveal your intention with the code. By doing so when people collaborate to work on this code it will be easier to debug. In swift you can start naming your identifiers with camel case.
Text values are called springs and are composed of characters. The reason it is called a string is because they are in a specific sequence. Characters in a spring can be letters numbers punctuation symbols.

When you create an identifier  you also need to declare whether it is a constant or variable. 
Constants help programmers because they never change and they can make assumptions about the code that uses them. Therefore less mistakes.
However variables change as the program runs. 
Hair length is a variable eye color is a constant

Programmers often use simulations to replicate systems and predict behavior. By modeling a system in a computer simulation people can see how the system responds to change and they can test hypotheses. To build a simulation, programmers need to consider which aspects of the system weâ€™ll model and how those aspects will change. Simulations are built on variables. In fact, computer simulations are powerful because of the incredible number of values they can compute for each variable and the interaction among many of variables.
